remove seconds from scrape.duration

rewrite imdb_scrape func by removing ret statements

how many scrapes are just unogs, many seem redirected to imdb by poor code logic

add tests for searching only imdb, comparing unogs and imdb duration within thresh, test for john wick 2

refactor edge case handling in scrape func for readability

add support for not_found items from list_3

can replace test comparing title to string with result.media in some cases
