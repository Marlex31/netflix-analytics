Types of media:

1. show name : season name/number : episode name/number

2. show name : episode name/number

3. movie name

+ titles/episodes that have colons inside


To identify the correct type, the first step is labeling the media piece as either a show, or a movie, by scraping IMDB

another confirmation would be comparing episodes between datasets, to prevent confusion (eg with an anime live action or movie based on a show arc)
	
determine type by colon number

some episodes are not named on netflix, might want to compare between last episode watched and the lenght of the show on imdb 



steps:

1. build a db with all the shows and movies watched, no duplicates, shows need a counter for watched episodes

how do I get the name of the media? compare text between columns, but what if the text has a season name, instead of season num??
- could count the num of mentions of the contents

Fate/Apocrypha: Part 1: Apocrypha: The Great Holy Grail War
Violet Evergarden: Special: Extra Episode: Episode 1

WTF IS THIS - if only 2 or less ep watched, then do not count - how do I know it's a show for the fate one - go from left to right or inverse?!

could just remove out these little shits
